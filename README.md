# timezone-buddy

A website for tracking the timezones of you and your buddies™.

I have a lot of buddies™ from USA and different countries. I can keep track of timezone of my EU friends because I know what their offset it from GMT+0, but my USA buddies™ use EST/CST/PST etc. which I don't know off the top of my head. So this is the solution to my problems and it will be the solution to your problems too!

## Website

Coming soon™.

## Run it locally

You'll need to create a `Firebase` project, configure it and put the configs inside `.env.local`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:NecRaul/timezone-buddies.git
cd timezone-buddies
npm install
npm run dev
```
